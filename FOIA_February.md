# FOIA February
I aimed to FOIA the DC government each day for February 2018. I came close, with 25 FOIAs. The goal was to, as a data journalist and open data advocate returning to DC, learn more about specific facets of DC government, answer curiosities, and see what I could find. It was fun! I learned a lot along the way.

Below is a table of FOIAs I filed in February and their status. I used [DC's FOIA platform](https://foia-dc.gov/app/palLogin.aspx).
