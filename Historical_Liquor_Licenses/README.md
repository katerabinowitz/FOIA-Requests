## What I requested:
>District of Columbia ABC Licensees from 2005 to present including the following: license number, status, applicant, trade name, address, SMD, class, description, date of license start, and date of license end.  
>(essentially the historical versions of this: http://abra.dc.gov/page/abc-licensees)

## What I received:
ABRA really came through here! They sent over xslx workbooks of every liquor license report since 2006 and were really helpful along the way.

## What I've done (so far):
[Standardize and join](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/blob/master/Historical%20Liquor%20Licenses/nightlifeReadIn.R) liquor license reports for bars, clubs, and restaurants to create a single timeline. 

[Clean](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/blob/master/Historical%20Liquor%20Licenses/nightlifeClean.R) the timeline to account for new places with the same license number and multiple places at a single address

[Geocode](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/blob/master/Historical%20Liquor%20Licenses/nightlifeGeo.R) address and assign neighborhood

[Here's the final](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/blob/master/Historical%20Liquor%20Licenses/nightlife0816.csv)
