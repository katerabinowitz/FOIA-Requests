# FOIA for Data from the DC Government
This is a repo of:
  1. How I FOIA (and maybe how you can too!)
  2. What I receive in response
  3. How I transform those FOIA responses into more usable data

## Let’s FOIA!
[DC Open Government Coalition](http://www.dcogc.org/content/foia) is a great resource for learning more about FOIA laws, the process, and your rights. 

[This is DC’s FOIA website.](http://dc.gov/page/freedom-information-act-foia)

### My two favorite places to file FOIAs are:

[MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/) is a place where you can file FOIA requests that are publicly seen and responded to. DC government is not always responsive on Muckrock, so I often use their preferred platform (below).

## How I FOIA:
Here is my [generic FOIA request template.](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/blob/master/FOIA_Resources/requestTemplate.md)

When agencies are unresponsive within the first 15 days, I file an appeal. [Here is my appeal template for when agencies don't respond.](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/blob/master/FOIA_Resources/Non%20Response%20Template.md)

Each repo has data or documents I've received, along with any transformations to make the data more accessible. 
For February 2018 I attempted to file a FOIA a day. I got close. [Here's the list and progress.](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/blob/master/FOIA_February.md)

Much of this guidance originated from Justin Grimes. If you find the information here helpful consider [rating him highly today.](https://justgrimes.review/)
