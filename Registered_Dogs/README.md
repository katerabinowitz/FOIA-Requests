## What I requested:
>The Washington D.C. Department of Health all dog licensing data for the entire timeline it is available, including:
>Breed, secondary breed, primary color, secondary color, name, sex, age, microchipped, spayed/neutered, and residence.
>This request encompasses dangerous dogs, spayed/neutered dogs, non spayed/neutered dogs, law enforcement, and service dogs. It is also requested the data indicate which type of dog the license refers to.

## What I received:
First I received the formatted Excel workbooks shown in the [No Geo Data folder](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/tree/master/Registered%20Dogs/No%20Geo%20Data). 
I went back and asked for some level of geographic granularity They provided the formatted Excel workbooks shown in the [w Zip Code folder](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/tree/master/Registered%20Dogs/w%20Zip%20Code).

## What I've done (so far):
Converted the formatted Excel workbooks in the [No Geo Data folder](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/tree/master/Registered%20Dogs/No%20Geo%20Data) 
into a single .csv via the R program in that folder. 

## To note
Data is limited to owners who actually request a dog license. So the dogs are likely a small subset of D.C. dogs and may be skewed based on populated more likely to request a license.
